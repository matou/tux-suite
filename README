Tux-Suite
=========

A few weeks ago I got myself a tuxdroid[0]. That little gui has a python API. I
love python. And yesterday I decided that it was time to finally let tux do
something. 


Items of the tux suite
======================

tux-pidgin-listener
-------------------

This extremely simple script listenes to DBus messages coming from pidgin and
reads all messages that are prefixed with "tux:".


tux-shell (planned)
---------

A shell to control the droid.


tux-mail-notifier (planned)
-----------------

I want the droid to notify me of new mail.


tux-notification (planned)
----------------

A way for all kinds of notification through the droid.
